Milestone 3
	Task1:
		1. To Extract keywords Locations and Fatalities, run the file 'Task1_Location_Fatalities_Final.ipynb'.
		2. To Extract keywords Event Type and Event Sub Type, run the file 'Task1_Event_SubEvent_Final.ipynb'.
		3. To Extract keywords Actor1 and Actor2, run the file 'Task1_Actor1_Actor2_Final'.
		4. To Extract keywords Inter1 and Inter2, run the file 'Task1_Inter1_Final' and 'Task1_Inter2_Final'.

	Task2:	
		Common for all steps - uploading the train and validation dataset.
		1. Run the file 'data_to_text_task2_base_milestone3.ipynb' for t5-base model
		2. Run the file 'data_to_text_task2_small_milestone3.ipynb' for t5-small model
		3. Run the file 'data_to_text_task2_large_milestone3.ipynb' for t5-large model

	Task3:
		1. For Approach 1, where we training the model only with number of unrests, run the file 'Task3_Approach1_Final.ipynb'.
		1. For Approach 2, where we training the model only with number of unrests and locations, run the file 'Task3_Approach2_Final.ipynb'.
